# Documentation

This folder contains all technical documentation.

## Files

- `api-contracts.md` – REST API endpoints and their request/response contracts.
- `README.md` – This file.

## Purpose

The documentation ensures:

- Clear backend/frontend contract-first development.  
- Alignment between team members on API shape and events.  
- Easier code reviews and onboarding of new team members.  

## How to Use

1. Before implementing a new feature, check API or event contracts here.  
2. Update this documentation if you add new endpoints or events.  
3. Always commit updated docs **before coding**, following commit rules.
